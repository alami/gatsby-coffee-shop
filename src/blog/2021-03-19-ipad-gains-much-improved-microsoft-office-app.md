The mobile app version of Office combines the company’s triumvirate of mobile productivity solutions — Office, Excel and PowerPoint — in one well-designed app.

These core apps are supplemented with extremely useful additional features (see below) and the combined software has the benefit of requiring far less space on your device than all three individual apps

The app was made available to iPhones and Android devices in 2019, but has only now made it to the iPad.

I think it hits the zeitgeist for mobile professionals, with a bunch of sensible feature and design decisions that remove a great deal of friction from getting work done while on the move.
