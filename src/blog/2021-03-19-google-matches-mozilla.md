Google plans to accelerate Chrome's release schedule to match rival Firefox's every-four-week cadence.

The Mountain View, Calif. company will also offer a new release channel, dubbed "Extended Stable," that will be refreshed every eight weeks, aimed at enterprises weary of frequent deployments.

"As we have improved our testing and release processes for Chrome and deployed bi-weekly security updates to improve our patch gap, it became clear that we could shorten our release cycle and deliver new features more quickly," Alex Mineer, technical program manager, Chrome operations, wrote in a [March 4 post to the Chromium blog](https://blog.chromium.org/2021/03/speeding-up-release-cycle.html).
