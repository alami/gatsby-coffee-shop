With the launch of Teams Connect at this weekâ€™s Ignite conference, Microsoft Teams users can now collaborate with external partners and clients in shared channels.

Available in private preview ahead of a full roll-out later this year, Teams Connect shared channels are accessible within the main Teams app view alongside regular channels. Users can continue to access Teams features such as text chat, video and voice within shared channels, as well as share content and co-author documents with external users in real-time.
