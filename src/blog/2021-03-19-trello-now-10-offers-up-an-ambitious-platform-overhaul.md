Productivity app Trello [announced a major redesign this week](https://blog.trello.com/a-whole-new-trello), adding features to help businesses better manage third-party integrations, new customizable cards and the ability to access workloads beyond the core whiteboard view.

The changes come after a year in which Trello said it saw a spike in users because of the rush to remote work caused by the COVID-19 pandemic; the company now boasts more than 50 million signups.

“During the pandemic, Trello became many people’s new offices in a remote-first world," Trello co-founder Michael Pryor wrote in a company blog post. Sign-ups rose 73% in March 2020, he said, compared to the same month a year earlier.
