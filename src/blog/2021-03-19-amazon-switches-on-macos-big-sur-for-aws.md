Delay may be the deadliest form of denial, but Amazon’s decision to introduce Mac support via AWS illustrates Apple’s growing importance in [enterprise IT](https://www.applemust.com/jnuc-apple-explains-its-approach-to-enterprise-tech/), as vendors across the board follow the money.

## **Big Sur in the cloud**

That importance is this week reflected by Amazon’s decision to offer [macOS Big Sur in the cloud within AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/mac/). The company originally confirmed plans to offer Big Sur support in early December when it first introduced support for Macs in the form of a fleet of [Mac minis](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3597396/review-m1-mac-mini-shows-a-bright-future-for-apple-silicon.html). Now, it seems those Macs have been upgraded and Amazon has introduced support for macOS Big Sur in its cloud.

The company says it will keep its Macs updated in sequence to Apple’s OS releases.

The move follows a similar announcement from Scaleway earlier this month when that company introduced [access to Mac mini systems in the cloud](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3605768/how-to-rent-a-virtual-m1-mac-mini-for-12-cents-an-hour.html). Others offering cloud-based Mac deployments include [Macstadium](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3431659/macstadium-announces-cloud-based-mac-iaas-for-developers.html), and now (since December, anyway), AWS.

It should be interesting down the road to learn what kind of energy cost-savings cloud-based providers bringing M1 Macs online are seeing, given the [huge difference](https://www.applemust.com/yes-you-can-cut-your-energy-bills-with-an-m1-mac-mini/) in power draw compared to Intel-based Macs.
