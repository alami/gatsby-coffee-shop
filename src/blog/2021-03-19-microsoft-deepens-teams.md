\[W]hat stands out for me in this new wave of innovation we're doing together across Dynamics 365 and with \[Microsoft] 365 is this need to connect systems of record with systems of engagement in order to create these new opportunities for business workflows that can really digitize the way companies work,” Emma Williams, corporate vice president of Microsoft Office Modern Workplace Transformation, said during a session at Ignite on Thursday.

The closer ties between Teams and Dynamics 365 should have a significant impact for users of both apps, said Raul Castanon, a senior research analyst at 451 Research, part of S&P Global Market Intelligence. The integrations can enable a workflow-centric approach that reduces friction in day-to-day tasks and leads to improved efficiencies, he said.

“Rather than users switching between business applications to get their work done, enabling collaboration features within ERP and CRM applications aligns more closely with business workflows,” said Castanon.

“By Microsoft bringing Teams and Dynamics 365 closer together, distributed sales, service and marketing teams are able to collaborate far more efficiently,” said Kyle Davis, a Gartner Research vice president.

For Dynamics 365 Sales, Teams chat can be embedded in the customer relationship management (CRM) app; sellers will also be able to continue one-to-one conversations with suggested colleagues working on a customer account and access team chats that mention the customer.
