Google has introduced a Workspace tier for front-line jobs such as retail, hospitality, and healthcare workers. The company today also unveiled new features around time management and productivity-tracking for the core Workspace — [formerly G Suite](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3584835/g-suite-is-now-workspace-as-google-adds-pricing-tier-feature-updates.html) — software.

The Workspace Frontline edition includes all of the standard Workspace apps such as Gmail, Calendar, and Chat, as well as advanced endpoint management to secure employee mobile devices.

“We've also made it easier for business teams to build custom AppSheet apps directly from Google Sheets and Drive so that frontline workers can digitize and streamline their work, whether it's collecting data in the field, reporting safety risks, or managing customer requests,” Javier Soltero, vice president and general manager of Google Workspace, [said in a blog post](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/workspace/the-future-of-work-with-google-workspace).
