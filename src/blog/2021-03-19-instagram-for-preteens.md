[Facebook](https://www.cnet.com/tags/facebook/) is looking to create a version of [Instagram](https://www.cnet.com/tags/instagram/) for kids under the age of 13, according to a Thursday [report](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facebook-instagram-for-children-under-13) by BuzzFeed News. The publication cited an internal company post about the project.

"I'm excited to announce that going forward, we have identified youth work as a priority for Instagram and have added it to our H1 priority list," Vishal Shah, Instagram's vice president of product, reportedly wrote on an employee message board. "We will be building a new youth pillar within the Community Product Group to focus on two things: (a) accelerating our integrity and privacy work to ensure the safest possible experience for teens and (b) building a version of Instagram that allows people under the age of 13 to safely use Instagram for the first time."
